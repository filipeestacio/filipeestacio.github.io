Civil Engineers design, build\n          and maintain the foundations for our modern society. Usually this\n          means our roads and bridges, drinking water, energy systems and\n          infrastructure for a cleaner environment. We are responsible for\n          understanding the needs of the civilian community and engineer answers\n          to them.\n        </p>\n        <Emphasis>But what if this also meant our digital world?</Emphasis>\n        <p>\n          <a\n            href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Every company is a tech company\n          </a>\n          . More than ever the web is how we interact with the world. And beyond\n          our favourite device is an overwhelming amount of digital\n          infrastructure to hold it all together. Our interfaces are getting\n          slicker. But are our applications providing the best solutions to our\n          problems?\n        </p>\n        <Emphasis>Are we sure we know what our problems are?</Emphasis>\n        <p>\n          Slicker. Faster. More flexible. It needs to do everything. Synergy.\n          Whichever last buzzword you've heard at a meeting. These are all\n          things we think or have thought we wanted in an application when we\n          are conceptualising it. And it usually falls short. This happens\n          because the designer or software developer didn't fully understand the\n          problem you are trying to solve or the client hasn't been able to\n          articulate it properly. Most of the time it's a bit of column A and a\n          bit of column B.\n        </p>\n        <Emphasis>I am a problem solver at heart. I fix things.</Emphasis>\n        <p>\n          No real world problem is too big to be tackled. If it seems that way,\n          we just haven't broken it down to solvable pieces just yet.
