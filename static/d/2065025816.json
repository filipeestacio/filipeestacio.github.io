Need to correct this and implement the correct functionality.\nA suggestion is to build a wrapper for the markdown component to take the children and the ...props. If the child is a string, to a string replacement based on regex ('/n' to '  /n' or something)."}],"totalCount":2}}},{"repo":{"__typename":"GITHUB_Repository","name":"freecodecamp-project-random-quote-machine","url":"https://github.com/filipeestacio/freecodecamp-project-random-quote-machine","description":"Solution to Freecodecamp's Random Quote Machine challenge for the Front End Libraries Projects","issues":{"nodes":[],"totalCount":0}}},{"repo":{"__typename":"GITHUB_Repository","name":"react-responsive-layouts","url":"https://github.com/filipeestacio/react-responsive-layouts","description":"Rendering different react components based on the size of the window.","issues":{"nodes":[],"totalCount":0}}}]}}}}
